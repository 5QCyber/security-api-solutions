# Microsoft Graph Security API Playbook Samples

This repository of playbook or workflow samples built using Azure LogicApps or Microsoft Flow show how to access Microsoft Graph Security API entities using the [Microsoft Graph Security API Logic Apps / Flow / PowerApps connectors](https://aka.ms/graphsecurityconnectors).

## Overview

 Microsoft Graph Security connectors for [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview), [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/), and [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), greatly simplify the development of automated security workflows. By building playbooks that use the Microsoft Graph Security connector, you can automate common security tasks across multiple security solutions. This reduces the time and resources required to triage, investigate, and remediate security alerts, without the cost and complexity of building and maintaining multiple integrations. Check out the samples in this repository to get started on some of these playbooks.

## Using the Playbooks  
You can download these sample playbooks and open to manage these in Visual Studio to run it in your environment as per the steps in [Manage logic apps with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/manage-logic-apps-with-visual-studio) guidance. You can build similar playbooks / workflows by following the logic provided in these samples as well.

## Using the Microsoft Graph Security API

The Microsoft Graph Security API provides a unified interface and schema to integrate with security solutions from Microsoft and ecosystem partners. This empowers customers to streamline security operations and better defend against increasing cyber threats. The Microsoft Graph Security API is a federated security aggregation service that sends queries to all onboarded security providers and aggregates the responses. Use Microsoft Graph to combine information from other services and the Security API to build rich cross-service applications for IT professionals or end users.     

## Getting Started
Download the sample playbook(s) and follow the steps in the [Microsoft Graph Security connector documentation](https://aka.ms/graphsecurityconnectors) to first get Azure Active Directory tenant administrator's consent to the published application ID for the connector and then to run playbooks in Azure Logic Apps or export the playbook via the Azure Logic Apps designer (Export option) to run in Microsoft Flow.
