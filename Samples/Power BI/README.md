## Using the Microsoft Graph Security API

The Microsoft Graph Security API provides a unified interface and schema to integrate with security solutions from Microsoft and ecosystem partners. This empowers customers to streamline security operations and better defend against increasing cyber threats. The Microsoft Graph Security API is a federated security aggregation service that sends queries to all onboarded security providers and aggregates the responses. Use Microsoft Graph to combine information from other services and the Security API to build rich cross-service applications for IT professionals or end users.
